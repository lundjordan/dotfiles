dotfiles
=======

Just another dotfile repo

mainly consists of dotfiles that are heavly customized for me (I know,
shocking).

For example: there are lots of vim related plugins and configs for python and
colemak

When I clone this repo on a new machine (or I end up switching/losing my OS), I run:
    initial_setup.py

It's basically a quick and dirty script that just makes links in my home dir
so that I can get my environment up and running quick. This way maintaining my
configs as they all reside within my home dir.
note: If the dest path exists, I make a backup of it incase I
it contains configurations that I want to keep.


This contains stuff for use with:
    - python
    - colemak
    - irssi
    - tmux
    - vim
    - vimperator
    - zsh
    - bash
